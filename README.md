A physics engine to simulate particle dynamics.
"Since Newton, mankind has come to realize that the laws of Physics are always expressed in the language of differential equations."
  -Steven Strogatz
Differential equations arise whenever it is easier to describe change than absolute amounts. In Physics(Newtonian mechanics), motion is often described in terms of force, and force determines acceleration, which is a statement about change.
